#American Express Assessment Day Pre-Work

Create a web page using HTML and JavaScript that allows up to ten letters of the alphabet to be entered into a text input field.

Display a button, named Calculate, which when pushed will perform the following functionality:
-Translate each alphabetic character entered as follows a=1, b=2 ,c=3, and so on to  z=26.
-Add the numeric values of each translated character together and display the result on the page.
-Check whether the result is a prime number or not and display some text saying which it is.

So for example if you enter aaa the result would be 3 which is a prime number.
If you entered  abc the result would be 6 which is not a prime number.
If you entered azb the result would be 29 which is a prime number.

Include any error handling you think may be relevant.
Optionally feel free to use cascading style sheets to enhance your web page appearance
